	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<div class="div"><p>This is a study on the top 14 countries with the highest average GDP over the course of five years (2013-2017). The goal is to reveal meaningful patterns by using data visualization, and to underline trends that will other wisely be ignored. In the research process, three major spending categories were studied and explored to speculate the economic growth in the selected countries.</p></div>
	
			<h3>Top 14 GDP Country Overall Spending in Billions ($) 2017</h3>
	
	<div id = "tot_spending_div" style = "width:80%; height:500px" class="chartsG"></div>
	
	<div class="div"><p>The most recent available data shows US has the highest spending (17238 B) overall while being followed closely by China(11778 B).</p></div>
	<h3> Data Overview </h3>
	<div id = "dataTable_div"
	     style = "width:80%; height:400px" class="chartsG"></div>
	<div class="div"><p>This table displays an overview of all data studied and used for the the study's visualization over the course of 5 years from 2013 to 2017. </p></div>
	<h3> Spending Per Capita in Billions ($)</h3>
	<div id = "totSpendCapita_div"
	     style = "width:80%; height:400px" class="chartsG"></div>
	<div class="div"><p>This chart is ranked by the amount of spending per capita in 2017 while Australia leads the ranking as the highest spender in 2017, it also has the highest average spending from 2013 to 2017. US no longer is the top spender by capita, proving that spending behavior can be varied by population.
</p></div>
	<h3> Total Spending vs GDP in Billions ($) 2017</h3>
	<div id = "total_gdp_spending_div"
	     style = "width:80%; height:400px" class="chartsG"></div>
	<div class="div"><p>To introduce more variables that could help explaining spending trend, we can take a closer look on how GDP could be compared to spending. In most recent year, 2017, all 14 countries have higher GDP than spending except Japan, which overspent the countries' market value of all the final goods and services produced annually.</p></div>

	<p>The following charts reveal Australia and UK have the highestest average education expenditure per capita over the years of 2013 to 2017.</p>

	<p>Instead of looking at percentage, the following graphs display actual spending figure and reveal a slightly different trend that Russia is no longer on the top list. Its actual expenditure in amount of dollars is in fact not as much as the other nations. </p>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<div class="div"><h3>This is a study aims to reveal the spending patterns of top 14 nations with highest average GDP over the year of 2013 to 2017. In exploring the data, three major spending categories were studied to measure economic growth in the selected countries:
			</h3>
			<h3>Education:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>A category with most missing data from China, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Canada. The remaining data reveals Australia as the highest average education expenditure. 
					</li>
					<li>In the year of 2014 to 2015 the rate of education expenditure fluctuates the most both in percent and fixed value.
					</li>
					<li>Education expenditure is directly related to healthcare expenditure per capita, suggesting that the more educated an individual the more like he/she is willing to invest in personal care.
					</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>Healthcare:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>With the most complete data, healthcare is ranked the highest spending category out of the three studied while US is the leading spending country in this category. 
					</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>Military:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Saudi Arabia is the leading country that invested the most in military.
					</li>
					<li>Military spending as a percent of GDP has almost identical distributions as it is per capita, suggesting that individual impact on military expenditure closely mirrors national wide distribution.
					</li>
					<li>
					It is also the category with the least average investment in years studies among the selected countries.	
					</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>Spending in relation to GDP and Population:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>It is expected there are no abnormal proportion in spending vs GDP. Spending have significant share in percent of GDP in all countries studied.
					</li>
					<li>
					There is no significant relation in population vs GDP. US leads the total GDP with considerable lower population.
					</li>	
				</ul>
			<h3>Overall, US is still the country with the most prominent economic growth in terms of its spending patterns and the value of GDP. However, the research is limited by missing education data, and other expenditure categories should also be considered in order to generate more substantial outcomes.
			</h3>
